Basically, the scraper will input a list of industries. It will then proceed
to create a comma-separated file in this format:
  industry,job_title1
  industry,job_title2
  industry2,job_title3
and so forth.

PART ONE (scraper.rb):
0. Initialize array.
1. Replace spaces with underscores and ampersands with '%26'.
2. Iterate through array of industries.
3. For each, interpolate the edited industry name into the URL form,
   https://wiki.mymentor.com/index.php?title=XXX&action=edit
   where XXX is. Build an array of URLs. (Maybe use #map.)
4. Then iterate through this array of URLs.
5. For each, download the contents of the page into a directory.

PART TWO (results_constructor.rb):
6. Iterate through the files, and for each, iterate through the lines.
7. Extract whatever fits into /\[\[(.+?)\]\]/.
8. Push that onto an array, constructing comma-separated lines.
9. Output to text file (actually, to the console is fine if that works).

PART THREE (masher.rb):
10. Grab and split the contents of industry-and-titles.txt.
11. Grab and split the contents of a2z.txt (but put general titles first).
12. Iterate the atoz array, constructing a hash with general titles as keys
    pointing to arrays of specialized job titles.
13. Iterate the iandt array.
14. For each general job title in iandt,
15. find the matching title as a key in atoz.
16. Iterate the iandt array
17. and construct a new pipe-separated string, putting that in an array.
18. Finally, output to a2z_industry_matchup.txt.
