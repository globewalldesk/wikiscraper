Basically, the scraper will input a list of industries. It will then proceed
to create a comma-separated file in this format:
  industry,job_title1
  industry,job_title2
  industry2,job_title3
and so forth.

PART ONE:
0. Initialize array.
1. Replace spaces with underscores and ampersands with '%26'.
2. Iterate through array of industries.
3. For each, interpolate the edited industry name into the URL form,
   https://wiki.mymentor.com/index.php?title=XXX&action=edit
   where XXX is. Build an array of URLs. (Maybe use #map.)
4. Then iterate through this array of URLs.
5. For each, download the contents of the page into a directory.

PART TWO:
6. Iterate through the files, and for each, iterate through the lines.
7. Extract whatever fits into /\[\[(.+?)\]\]/.
8. Push that onto an array, constructing comma-separated lines.
9. Output to text file (actually, to the console is fine if that works).
